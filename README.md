Simple Blog application in django

Requirements:

Django 2.2.8
Python 3.6.9

- This is the simple blog application for user

- User will be created by only the super user from the backend

- There are 2 types of user here first "Django Super User" who can manage all the data. Second, "Blog User" who can log into the admin panel and access only the Blog that are related to him and also change his profile information while Super User can see all the information of other users too.

- We have customized a django admin panel functionality in a way that we don't have need to create login functionality and blog management functionality from the front-side. Inspite of doing the work on those simple functionality, we used default django admin panel login functionality for managing the user specific data.

(1) SuperUser Authentication:
user: nishith
pwd: Nishith@123

(2) Blog User

user: user1
pwd: qqwwaasszzxx

user:user2
pwd: qqwwaasszzxx
